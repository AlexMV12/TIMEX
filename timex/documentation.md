`TIMEX` is a Python package which implements a pipeline for time-series forecasting.

The pipeline consists in:

- time-series data ingestion;
- time-series pre-processing; 
- time-series analysis and prediction;
- results visualization.

While `TIMEX` is intended to be use in a fully automatic way (which means that each
step is automatically computed, without user intervention), users can also take
advantage of single part of the framework.
